# mild-jelly Group Project

## How to Run
To run this program, first clone the repository and enter the 'mild-jelly' directory using the terminal. After entering the repository, run the command `python3 -m http.server`. Enjoy!

## Project Description 
We each began the process by discussing commonalities within our group and discovered that all of us enjoy listening to music. However, we each have different listening habits. These habits include, but are not limited to, the music platform we use, how frequently we seek out new music, and the occasions on which we listen to music. However, we also agreed that although existing features like Spotify and Apple Music are useful, they lack an extra level of nuance that we feel would elevate the music listening experience. This led us to wonder if we could create an AI-powered on-demand Personal DJ. This would provide a vast array of features such as the generation of songs based on a user-selected "mood" and the creation of playlists with a desired percentage of "new songs", all of which could all be fine-tuned and personalized using parameter sliders.

Given that the majority of people across the world regularly listen to music, we believe that our solution would be interesting to a wide variety of people. Additionally, music listening can have an untold number of uses and benefits to different people and situations. However, we have listed a few of the key groups that we believe our solution can benefit in meaningful ways below:

1. Party/events hosts: can aggregate attendees' music data to find overlap and generate a playlist that everyone will enjoy. This can also include places such as the Maine Mall or Bowdoin's dining halls. This can improve consumersâ€™ experiences.

2. Students: can get playlists generated that will specifically help them stay focused during long study sessions such as midterms or finals weeks.

3. Mental Health: music has been shown to have significant benefits on stress and mental health and the solution could be adopted by therapists to assist in their work or just by the general population to improve day-to-day mental health

4. Content creators: can find the trend and tailor their music to the general public, and their music will also be recommended to the right audience at the right time when the users are in the right mood.

5. Tech/AI Lovers: this will create more creative working opportunities for those people to develop cool algorithms with their expertise.

## Notes
1. There are fours pages total in this program. Two of the pages can be accessed from the home and the remaining page can be accessed by clicking the album photo in the "My Playlists" tab.
2. This application is best experienced when used on a mobile screen. This can be accomplished on MacOS by:
    i. right-clicking on the page
    ii. select inspect
    iii. click the icon that shows two screen, one vertical and the other horizontal.
    IV. Click on the 'responsive design' button above the page view to select the device which you'd like to simulate.
